#Architecture
The project uses MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel with Coordinator) architecture with SwiftUI:

Models: Data structures and business logic
Views: SwiftUI views for UI
ViewModels: Business logic and data transformation
Coordinator: Navigation management
Services: API communication and data fetching

#Key Design Decisions

SwiftUI: Modern, declarative UI framework
Async/await: Modern concurrency for network calls
Protocol-oriented: Interfaces for better testing
MVVM-C: Clear separation of concerns

Press âŒ˜U or navigate to Product > Test

The test suite includes:

ViewModel tests
Model tests
Network service mocking
